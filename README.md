# University-student-identification-and-stopping-bus is a Machine learning project. 
We waved our hands in front of a bus to stop. But, there is also a chance for local people to do the same to get on the varsity bus. 
So we develop a solution for the bus driver. 
When we start to wave our hands, the system in the bus will detect me and extract my face and match it with the university students. 
If we are university students, the system will green signal to the bus driver, otherwise, it will give a red signal



Here extract_images.py is used to extract faces for training.
main_code.py is the main program.
